# Kitchen Chaos 🍳

**Kitchen Chaos** is a 3D Unity game inspired by the popular game **Overcooked**, where players manage a chaotic kitchen, prepare meals, and serve them under tight time constraints. This project demonstrates advanced coding techniques, clean architecture principles, and a creative approach to game development.

## 🛠 Features

- **Dynamic Gameplay**:
  - Players must manage time and resources effectively.
- **Clean Architecture**:
  - Designed with maintainability in mind, using techniques like:
    - **Event Handlers**: To decouple components and improve communication between systems.
    - **Separation of Logic from Visuals**: Ensuring a clear distinction between game logic and UI.
    - **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each script handles only one responsibility, making the codebase modular and easy to extend.
    - **Scriptable Objects**: Used for managing reusable data and simplifying data handling across the project.
- **Custom Modifications**:
  - Built upon a tutorial, but added significant features and enhancements, including:
    - New gameplay mechanics.
    - Personalized logic systems using Scriptable Objects.

## 🚀 What I Learned

This project helped me achieve a deeper understanding of Unity and game development principles:

1. **Scriptable Objects**:
   - Simplified the management of game data like recipes, ingredients, and levels.
   - Allowed for modular and scalable designs by decoupling data from runtime logic.
2. **Advanced Programming Techniques**:
   - Event-driven programming to enhance code efficiency.
   - Decoupling systems using clean architecture principles.
   - Applying **SOLID principles**, especially the **Single Responsibility Principle**, to ensure code remains maintainable and easy to extend.
3. **Unity Workflow Mastery**:
   - From setting up scenes to scripting and debugging, I became comfortable with Unity's tools and ecosystem.
4. **Problem-Solving**:
   - Enhanced and expanded upon the tutorial’s foundation, adding new mechanics, systems, and features independently.

## 🔧 Ongoing Development: Multiplayer Integration

I'm currently working on transforming **Kitchen Chaos** into a multiplayer experience using **Unity's Network Manager**. My goals include:

- Enabling real-time collaboration or competition between players.
- Understanding and implementing networking concepts like synchronization, latency handling, and client-server communication.
- Designing multiplayer systems that integrate seamlessly with the existing architecture.
